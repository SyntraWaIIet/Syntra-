## 🧠 AI Engine

Syntra’s intelligence isn’t cosmetic — it runs deep. Each module below is built to interpret on-chain behavior, learn from past patterns, and respond in real time.

### 🧪 SignalScan Engine  
Dissects the DNA of every token you receive.

```python
def analyze_token(token):
    issues = []
    if token.get("mint_authority") == "open":
        issues.append("Unrestricted Mint Access")
    if token.get("freeze_authority") == "active":
        issues.append("Freezable Transfers")
    if not token.get("liquidity_locked", True):
        issues.append("Unlocked Liquidity Pool")
    return issues
```
#### 🧠 AI Insight: Learns from flagged contracts, flash scams, and chain anomalies to auto-warn users in real time.

### ⚖️ TrustWeight Index
#### Generates a stability score for every token.

```python
def get_score(token):
    score = 100
    if token.get("blacklist"): score -= 35
    if token.get("mint_authority") == "open": score -= 20
    if not token.get("liquidity_locked", True): score -= 25
    if token.get("owner_changed_recently"): score -= 10
    return max(0, score)
```
#### 📊 AI Insight: Built on exploit analytics and real incident data from the ecosystem.

### 🐋 Dominance Scanner
#### Reveals whale-heavy imbalances and clustering risks.

```js
function whaleImbalance(holders) {
  const whales = holders.filter(h => h.balance >= 0.04);
  return whales.length > 6 ? "Whale Cluster Detected" : "Healthy Spread";
}
```
#### 🧭 AI Insight: Helps detect early signs of soft rugs or exit pump coordination.

### 🌐 Aura Mapper
#### Converts numerical scores into simple, emotional risk tags.

```js
function tagRisk(score) {
  if (score >= 85) return "🟢 Secure"
  if (score >= 50) return "🟡 Caution"
  return "🔴 Hazard"
}
```
#### 🌱 AI Insight: Risk tags adapt as the AI learns from evolving token behaviors.

### 📈 Behavior Timeline Builder
#### Constructs a long-view memory of every token’s behavior.

```python
def record_behavior(token_id, label, score):
    entry = {
        "token": token_id,
        "label": label,
        "score": score,
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    }
    history_db[token_id] = {**history_db.get(token_id, {}), **entry}
```
#### 📂 AI Insight: Creates predictive patterns based on historical scoring, improving future alerts with every new signal.
